            <h2>Stephen Hawking Short Biography</h2> 
            <p>Hawking studied physics at University College, Oxford (B.A., 1962), and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Ph.D., 1966). He was chosen an exploration individual at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge. In the mid 1960s Hawking contracted amyotrophic horizontal sclerosis, a serious degenerative neuromuscular illness. He kept on working not withstanding the sickness' continuously impairing impacts.</p>

            <p>Hawking worked primarily in the field of general relativity and especially on the material science of dark openings. In 1971 he proposed the formation, following the huge explosion, of various articles containing as much as one billion tons of mass yet consuming just the space of a proton. These items, called smaller than usual black holes, are exceptional in that their tremendous mass and gravity necessitate that they be managed by the laws of relativity, while their small size necessitates that the laws of quantum mechanics concern them moreover. In 1974 Hawking recommended that, as per the forecasts of quantum hypothesis, dark gaps produce subatomic particles until they exhaust their vitality lastly detonate. Hawking's work incredibly prodded endeavors to hypothetically depict the properties of dark openings, objects about which it was recently believed that nothing could be known. His work was additionally significant on the grounds that it indicated these properties' relationship to the laws of old style thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.

            <p>Hawkingâ€™s commitments to material science or physics earned him numerous uncommon distinctions. In 1974 the Royal Society chose him probably the most youthful individual. He became an educator of gravitational physics at Cambridge in 1977, and in 1979 he was designated to Cambridge's Lucasian residency of arithmetic, a post once held by Isaac Newton. Hawking was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 1982 and a Companion of Honor in 1989. He additionally got the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 2006. In 2008 he acknowledged a meeting research seat at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.</p>
